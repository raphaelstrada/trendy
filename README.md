> You are working on a team that is building a music database application.  The back end team is currently building some REST services and has provided a prototype of the service to you.  You are responsible for building the front end to display Artist, Album and Song.  The architect has defined the entities as follows:

Using Angular or Vue design an application to retrieve data from the REST endpoints and display it for the user.  Users will need to be able to see the following fields:
1.	Artist Name
2.	Album Name
3.	Year Released
4.	Song Track #
5.	Song Name
The product owner has mandated the following technical requirements:
•	Only 10 rows of data should be shown on a page at a time.
•	Pagination should be quick and easy for the users
•	Any column shown on the screen should be sortable in Ascending and Descending order.
The application architect has mandated that all calls to the any REST services must be authorized using a JWT token in the Authorization header of each request.  The team has provided the following as a sample Bearer token to be used:
